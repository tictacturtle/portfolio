                        <p style= font-size:16px class = 'ind g'>3 years ago if someone asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up I would have responded with astronaut. 2 years ago that response changed to building the rockets that astronauts flew in. 1 year ago it changed again to programming the rocket ship that the astronaut flies in. Now, I am interested in the crossroad between programming and neuroscience, a crucial part of the artificial intelligence movement that is picking up speed. Video games have always been one of my passions, however now I find more pleasure in figuring out the coding behind them. Virtual reality is heavily present in the video game industry, the next level of which is artificial intelligence. I hope to work as a computer programmer in a company that works on creating artificial intelligence in the future, making robots that can assist people rather than replace them. In order to achieve this goal, I have already taken plenty of summer classes related to computer programming and am currently in the Engineering Academy in Dublin High School. I am able to explore different fields of engineering through courses I have taken such as computer programming and software engineering as well as principles of engineering. I have also taken a course in Cognitive Neuroscience at UC Berkeley to understand the human brain more in order to possibly replicate its features through technology. I hope to gain an internship during my high school career in order to further expose myself to the workings of artificial intelligence so that I will be prepared to enter the workforce after college.</p>

                                <p style= font-size:16px class = 'ind g'>Finding a job in any field is difficult, much less finding a job in a field that has just been created. Being on the front of an industry that will be staple in future homes and jobs requires both ingenuity and technical skill. My outside-of-the-box thinking style and ability to learn quickly and adapt to different scenarios allow me to fulfill both of those criterion. Recently a project required that we simulate a solar and hydrogen vehicle for a project in Netlogo, however I chose to instead make my vehicle a penguin. Though this may seem unconventional to some, unconventional is exactly what is needed in a field that has nothing like it from the past to reference. I am also a quick learner when it comes to skills and programs. Having taken Computer Science and not being involved in the robotics team at the school, I was very new to VEX parts. However, as the school year progressed and I was using them in projects, I eventually learned both the names and purpose of different pieces through listening to my fellow peers and experimenting myself. Being willing to try new things and accept that one does not know everything is one of the most important skills to have, as it creates opportunity for growth from any situation. </p>

                                <p style= font-size:16px class = 'ind g'>My personality also helps bolster my chances of achieving my goal of working in the artificial intelligence field. As a natural extrovert, uncommon in the engineering and technology industries, I am able to thrive in group projects and assignments. I am able to maintain a positive attitude throughout even the most stressful situations, which aso helps my fellow group members calm down and remained focus indirectly. Because engineering is a field that involves group work, this skill is very important to have. Even though I am able to keep up a positive environment, I remain organized and make sure work is delegated and turned in on time. Both my personality and technical skills set me up to be a computer programmer in the artificial intelligence field.
