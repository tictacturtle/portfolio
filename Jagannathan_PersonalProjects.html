                        In 8th grade, 3 of my classmates and I participated in the FLL Robotics competition. During this project we had to prepare a robot to complete tasks as well as a project related to the given topic. That year the topic was surrounding trash, and how to use it for different purposes. We used the Ev3 system and program to code our robot and built it using lego parts. We conducted experiments to test the probability that we completed tasks, and used the information gathered to base our decisions off of. On the project side, we worked hard to get thoughts from professionals on our idea. We decided to base our project off of food that is wasted or thrown away because of its appearance before it even reaches the farm. In order to use these perfectly good foods, we decided to blend them into smoothie mixes and sell them to smoothie chains such as Jamba Juice. We interviewed a smoothie shop owner to get her ideas on the topic before exploring it further. We then did a taste test in our school and found that 40% of kids did not taste any differences between the ugly fruit smoothie and the regular fruit smoothie. After this we reached out to a real start up that centered around ugly fruits, and planned to meet them. They were generous enough to give us a tour of their warehouse and allow us to publish an article on their blog. In the competition, we ended up winning the overall champion award, as well as the robot award for scoring the most points for the completed tasks. This project was influential in helping me develop engineering skills as well as life skills such as reaching out to companies and sending professional emails.
