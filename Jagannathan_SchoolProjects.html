                            Scratch Project
                        </h4>
                        <p><em>From 8/30/16 - 9/16/16 | Computer Science and Software Engineering 2016-2017 </em></p>
                        <p> The Scratch Project was a two person project that involved the program Scratch. For this project we had to choose to develop either a story or a game using the language that Scratch provides. My partner, Ryan, and I decided to make a game based off of a game that we had both played previously. It centered around eating creatures smaller than you and avoiding creatures bigger than you until you reach a certain amount of points. During this project I learned how to work in a team while programming as well as how to change our game for the benefit of the players of the game. The flowcharts and documentation helped me understand that sharing how your game or product with others is one of the most important parts of a job in this field. A main component of this game was variables since there was lots of data such as score and energy to keep track of. You can play our project by clicking the play button to the right.

                            App Inventor Project
                        </h4>
                        <p><em>From 9/19/16 - 10/17/16 | Computer Science and Software Engineering 2016-2017</em></p>
                        <p> The App Inventor Project was a two person project in which we first built a basic game from a given tutorial and then brainstormed and implemented new features that we thought would enhance the game. For this project, my partner, Matt, and I chose to build a game similar to the popular game Flappy Bird. The player would tap the screen to make the bird jump and the bird would fall if not tapped. The object of the game was to maneuver the bird around spiked pegs that randomly stuck out the side of the screen. For this game we implemented features such as a pause/resume button, a coin system, and just began working on a shop system before the final gallery walk. Unfortunately we could not get the shop system to work in time, which taught us a common problem in the programming world. We learned that it is important to understand your abilities so that you can realistically plan how much you can achieve, and not give your client the feeling of false hope when you agree to code what they want. </p>

                            Image Manipulation Project
                        </h4>
                        <p><em>From 3/13/17 - 3/24/17 | Computer Science and Software Engineering 2016-2017</em></p>
                        <p> The Image Manipulation Project was a two person project that surrounded the vast topic of image manipulation. Groups were asked to choose one of four clients (cause, family, product, or developer) to aim their manipulation towards. An example of a family oriented project would be putting a border around an image of a family provided. The code had to work on any image that was selected and put into a specific images folder, meaning that it could not be particular based on height, width, color, or even transparency. We brainstormed a couple of ideas such as having a transparent font or making only the distinct features of an image (the eyes, mouth, and nose if it was a picture of a person) visible. We ended up going with the transparent text. This was relatively simple since we just had to make a transparent mask with the word 100% transparent and the rest of the background only 40% transparent. We were able to apply our project to many of the clients and could easily change the word printed in the mask. If we continued with this project we could have written code to make a mask of a word using coordinates that are relative to the size of the image provided. Ultimately we reached our goal of making a product that would be of use to our clients, the family and the cause.

                            Solar Hydrogen Vehicle Project
                        </h4>
                        <p><em>From 11/1/17 - 11/17/17 | Principles of Engineering 2017-2018</em></p>
                        <p> The Solar Hydrogen Vehicle Project was a four person project that required a recommendation for Tesla Motors, regarding whether they should use solar or hydrogen fuel and how they should wire the cells on a bread board. For this project our group had to test various configurations of solar and hydrogen fuel cells on a vehicle of our design for efficiency, speed, and practicality. During the project, I mainly focused on documentation, as well as the more technical aspects of the project such as breadboarding. I ran the tests on the vehicle and organized the time results on the final documentation. After many rebuilds of our vehicle, we were able to test with 1 solar cell, 2 solar cells, 1 hydrogen cell, and 2 hydrogen cells, with 2 of those configured in parallel and the other two in series. After our testing we concluded that the solar allowed for greater speeds with our vehicle, however it was not practical to be the only source of energy for a car since cars at Tesla Motors should definitely run at night time too. We ultimately recommended 2 solar cells wired in parallel to Tesla, so that if one malfunctions then the other continues, however we also noted that hydrogen fuel cells would be useful to have in backup emergencies, though they are dangerous and take time to charge in our case.
