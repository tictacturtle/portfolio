                            <p> The App Inventor Project was a two person project in which we first built a basic game from a given tutorial and then brainstormed and implemented new features that we thought would enhance the game. For this project, my partner, Matt, and I chose to build a game similar to the popular game Flappy Bird. The player would tap the screen to make the bird jump and the bird would fall if not tapped. The object of the game was to maneuver the bird around spiked pegs that randomly stuck out the side of the screen. For this game we implemented features such as a pause/resume button, a coin system, and just began working on a shop system before the final gallery walk. Unfortunately we could not get the shop system to work in time, which taught us a common problem in the programming world. We learned that it is important to understand your abilities so that you can realistically plan how much you can achieve, and not give your client the feeling of false hope when you agree to code what they want. Overall this project was great for learning about how to work as a team to achieve a common goal, how to plan realistically to predict what you can accomplish in a time period, and how to properly tailor an app to the cusotmer. </p>

                            As a member of the Dublin High School Engineering Academy, I was paired with a mentor in my career field of interest during my junior year of highschool. My mentor's name was Claire Robertson, who is a Biomedical Engineer and Postdoctoral Fellow at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory specializing in cell biology. Throughout the program we met once a month and discussed various topics necessary for a successful career such as goal setting, networking, and college planning. She offered me valuable advice on what interviewers are looking for in candidates who are applying, which will be very useful to me for summer programs as well as when I enter the workforce after college. Because her interests aligned with mine, she was also able to inform me about research opportunities in college as well as study abroad programs, both of which I am planning to do in whichever college I choose.Her experiences at UCSD and UCI make me more excited to go to college and pursue a career that I will enjoy working in. Having the opportunity to have a mentor like this who is actually in the field was very valuable and helped me understand the areas that I need to improve in before going to college or starting a career.

                            During my high school career I have had many opportunities offered to me in regards to field trips and guest speakers. These opportunities are effective in exposing me to the wide range of careers that I can pursue as I complete high school and look towards colleges. One field trip that was especially valuable to me was the field trip that we had to Google and Santa Clara University recently. The speed at which the spots for the field trip filled up was not surprising considering the fact that most engineering kids dream of working at Google in the future. Going to the Google office legitimized all the rumors about the fun and energetic work environment that the company strives to achieve. It was amazing to hear the stories of all of the individuals working there, seeing as no two people had the same path in terms to their education and final career. It was comforting to know that the employees at Google formed clubs and classes to cultivate their own hobbies and meet other people like them, essentially making work into an extended college experience. The field trip was also memorable because James Morehead, the person who worked with the engineering department to organize the field trip, is the father of one of my cross country teammates, Evvie Morehead. The second half of the day we visited Santa Clara University and had an inside look into the resources available to the engineering students on campus. While schools such as Berkeley and MIT are well known for their academic success, visiting SCU taught me that smaller schools are actually more immersive. In classes with less people, the professor has more time to spend on you and your future versus in a huge lecture with hundreds of kids. The college had tons of equipment such as a machine to test the ductility of metal and another machine that measures lift and drag on an airplane wing. As I apply for colleges in the coming years, I will now be sure to take the school size into account, since I want to have a hands-on experience in college to prepare me for the workforce later on.

                            The Engineering Academy also organizes guest speakers that present during our class time. These talks provide us insight into different fields of engineering, as well as the education necessary to enter the workforce. One speaker that opened my eyes to the applications of engineering was Maynard Holliday. This was the first guest speaker we had, so the fact that I continue to reference his speech nearing the end of the year can be attributed to the impact that it had on me. Mr. Holliday worked on the Chernobyl project, dealing with engineering a dome that would enclose the radiation exposed after the Chernobyl accident in Russia. During his time in Russia, he had to deal with a language barrier, however he noted that mathematics and science were universal. Mr.Holliday’s speech moved me so much because it reinforced the idea that engineering has the potential to save thousands of lives. The traditional computer programmer sitting behind a desk may not be directly affecting the physical lives of civilians as Mr. Holliday did, however they could be contributing to the coding of mobile devices that will improve the ease of life for thousands of civilians as well. With such a daunting task, it can be stressful at times to plan and brainstorm, however I really admired Mr. Hallidays enthusiasm and pure passion towards his job. Mr. Holliday had the opportunity to travel around the world doing something he loved, also helping others in the process, which is something I hope to achieve some time during my career.
