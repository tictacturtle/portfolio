                            <p style= font-size:14px class = 'ind g'>3 years ago if someone asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up I would have responded with astronaut. 2 years ago that response changed to building the rockets that astronauts flew in. 1 year ago it changed again to programming the rocket ship that the astronaut flies in. Now, I am interested in the crossroad between programming and neuroscience, a crucial part of the artificial intelligence movement that is picking up speed. Video games have always been one of my passions, however now I find more pleasure in figuring out the coding behind them. Virtual reality is heavily present in the video game industry, the next level of which is artificial intelligence. I hope to work as a computer programmer in a company that works on creating artificial intelligence in the future, making robots that can assist people rather than replace them. In order to achieve this goal, I have already taken plenty of summer classes related to computer programming and am currently in the Engineering Academy in Dublin High School. I am able to explore different fields of engineering through courses I have taken such as computer programming and software engineering as well as principles of engineering. I have also taken a course in Cognitive Neuroscience at UC Berkeley to understand the human brain more in order to possibly replicate its features through technology. I hope to gain an internship during my high school career in order to further expose myself to the workings of artificial intelligence so that I will be prepared to enter the workforce after college.</p>
                            <p style= font-size:14px class = 'ind g'>Finding a job in any field is difficult, much less finding a job in a field that has just been created. Being on the front of an industry that will be staple in future homes and jobs requires both ingenuity and technical skill. My outside-of-the-box thinking style and ability to learn quickly and adapt to different scenarios allow me to fulfill both of those criterion. Recently a project required that we simulate a solar and hydrogen vehicle for a project in Netlogo, however I chose to instead make my vehicle a penguin. Though this may seem unconventional to some, unconventional is exactly what is needed in a field that has nothing like it from the past to reference. I am also a quick learner when it comes to skills and programs. Having taken Computer Science and not being involved in the robotics team at the school, I was very new to VEX parts. However, as the school year progressed and I was using them in projects, I eventually learned both the names and purpose of different pieces through listening to my fellow peers and experimenting myself. Being willing to try new things and accept that one does not know everything is one of the most important skills to have, as it creates opportunity for growth from any situation. </p>
                            <p style= font-size:14px class = 'ind g'>My personality also helps bolster my chances of achieving my goal of working in the artificial intelligence field. As a natural extrovert, uncommon in the engineering and technology industries, I am able to thrive in group projects and assignments. I am able to maintain a positive attitude throughout even the most stressful situations, which aso helps my fellow group members calm down and remained focus indirectly. Because engineering is a field that involves group work, this skill is very important to have. Even though I am able to keep up a positive environment, I remain organized and make sure work is delegated and turned in on time. 	</p>
                            <p style= font-size:14px class = 'ind g'>Both my personality and technical skills set me up to be a computer programmer in the artificial intelligence field.

	                			As a member of the Dublin High School Engineering Academy, I was paired with a mentor in my career field of interest during my junior year of highschool. My mentor's name was Claire Robertson, who is a Biomedical Engineer and Postdoctoral Fellow at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory specializing in cell biology. Throughout the program we met once a month and discussed various topics necessary for a successful career such as goal setting, networking, and college planning. She offered me valuable advice on what interviewers are looking for in candidates who are applying, which will be very useful to me for summer programs as well as when I enter the workforce after college. Because her interests aligned with mine, she was also able to inform me about research opportunities in college as well as study abroad programs, both of which I am planning to do in whichever college I choose.Her experiences at UCSD and UCI make me more excited to go to college and pursue a career that I will enjoy working in. Having the opportunity to have a mentor like this who is actually in the field was very valuable and helped me understand the areas that I need to improve in before going to college or starting a career.

	                			During my high school career I have had many opportunities offered to me in regards to field trips and guest speakers. These opportunities are effective in exposing me to the wide range of careers that I can pursue as I complete high school and look towards colleges. One field trip that was especially valuable to me was the field trip that we had to Google and Santa Clara University recently. The speed at which the spots for the field trip filled up was not surprising considering the fact that most engineering kids dream of working at Google in the future. Going to the Google office legitimized all the rumors about the fun and energetic work environment that the company strives to achieve. It was amazing to hear the stories of all of the individuals working there, seeing as no two people had the same path in terms to their education and final career. It was comforting to know that the employees at Google formed clubs and classes to cultivate their own hobbies and meet other people like them, essentially making work into an extended college experience. The field trip was also memorable because James Morehead, the person who worked with the engineering department to organize the field trip, is the father of one of my cross country teammates, Evvie Morehead. The second half of the day we visited Santa Clara University and had an inside look into the resources available to the engineering students on campus. While schools such as Berkeley and MIT are well known for their academic success, visiting SCU taught me that smaller schools are actually more immersive. In classes with less people, the professor has more time to spend on you and your future versus in a huge lecture with hundreds of kids. The college had tons of equipment such as a machine to test the ductility of metal and another machine that measures lift and drag on an airplane wing. As I apply for colleges in the coming years, I will now be sure to take the school size into account, since I want to have a hands-on experience in college to prepare me for the workforce later on.

	                		    The Engineering Academy also organizes guest speakers that present during our class time. These talks provide us insight into different fields of engineering, as well as the education necessary to enter the workforce. One speaker that opened my eyes to the applications of engineering was Maynard Holliday. This was the first guest speaker we had, so the fact that I continue to reference his speech nearing the end of the year can be attributed to the impact that it had on me. Mr. Holliday worked on the Chernobyl project, dealing with engineering a dome that would enclose the radiation exposed after the Chernobyl accident in Russia. During his time in Russia, he had to deal with a language barrier, however he noted that mathematics and science were universal. Mr.Holliday’s speech moved me so much because it reinforced the idea that engineering has the potential to save thousands of lives. The traditional computer programmer sitting behind a desk may not be directly affecting the physical lives of civilians as Mr. Holliday did, however they could be contributing to the coding of mobile devices that will improve the ease of life for thousands of civilians as well. With such a daunting task, it can be stressful at times to plan and brainstorm, however I really admired Mr. Hallidays enthusiasm and pure passion towards his job. Mr. Holliday had the opportunity to travel around the world doing something he loved, also helping others in the process, which is something I hope to achieve some time during my career.
